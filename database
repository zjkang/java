Transaction: 
  ACID: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID
  C: 一致性,即在事务开始之前和事务结束以后，数据库的完整性约束没有被破坏
  
  

Isolation:
  Read Uncommited(最高的性能，但可能出现脏读，不可重复读，幻读)
  Read commited(可能出现不可重复读，幻读)
  Repeatable Read(可能出现幻读)
  Serializable(最低的性能，一次只能执行一个事务，但避免了上述所有情况)

Select statement

https://www.w3schools.com/sql/default.asp

SELECT TOP number column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name;
WHERE condition
GROUP BY column_name(s)
ORDER BY column1, column2, ... ASC|DESC;

SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE condition
GROUP BY column_name(s)
HAVING condition
ORDER BY column_name(s);

SELECT COUNT(CustomerID), Country
FROM Customers
GROUP BY Country
HAVING COUNT(CustomerID) > 5
ORDER BY COUNT(CustomerID) DESC;

SELECT Employees.LastName, COUNT(Orders.OrderID) AS NumberOfOrders
FROM Orders
INNER JOIN Employees ON Orders.EmployeeID = Employees.EmployeeID
WHERE LastName = 'Davolio' OR LastName = 'Fuller'
GROUP BY LastName
HAVING COUNT(Orders.OrderID) > 25;

The GROUP BY statement is often used with aggregate functions (COUNT(), MAX(), MIN(), SUM(), AVG()) to group the result-set by one or more columns
The HAVING clause was added to SQL because the WHERE keyword cannot be used with aggregate functions


UPDATE table_name
SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ...
WHERE condition;

DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;

A JOIN clause is used to combine rows from two or more tables, based on a related column between them
(INNER) JOIN: Returns records that have matching values in both tables
LEFT (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records from the left table, and the matched records from the right table
RIGHT (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records from the right table, and the matched records from the left table
FULL (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records when there is a match in either left or right table

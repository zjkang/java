1. Install JDK first


2. Install Maven

2.2) Setting Maven Environment Variables - M2_HOME and Path
The next step is to set up the environment variables - M2_HOME and Path. 
We have to add the Maven bin directory to the Path variable. Open .bash_profile in your favorite text editor and add below lines to the end of it.

export M2_HOME="/Users/pankaj/Downloads/apache-maven-3.6.3"
PATH="${M2_HOME}/bin:${PATH}"
export PATH

$ mvn -version

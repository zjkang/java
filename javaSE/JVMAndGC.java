Q21. What are the different types of garbage collectors in Java?

Garbage collection in Java a program which helps in implicit memory management. 
Since in Java, using the new keyword you can create objects dynamically, 
which once created will consume some memory. Once the job is done and there are 
no more references left to the object, Java using garbage collection destroys the object 
and relieves the memory occupied by it.

Java provides four types of garbage collectors:

Serial Garbage Collector
Parallel Garbage Collector
CMS Garbage Collector
G1 Garbage Collector
